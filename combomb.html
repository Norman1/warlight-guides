        <p>The commander is worth 7 armies. The commander needs to get killed with 1 hit and can not get weakened.</p>
        <p>The bomb card kills half of the bombed armies rounded up. For example if you bomb a stack of 5 armies +
            opponent commander you kill 3 armies and the commander is unharmed.</p>

        <h2>Picking Guide</h2>
        <p>Either pick fast (+-4 seconds) or pick slow. Picking within 12 seconds will neither give you first pick nor
            time to think about your picks. Our bomb squad style is to pick slow.</p>
        <p>By default, look for a picking strategy of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick South America â†’ We expect to lose that pick</li>
            <li>Cover both North America and Europe. Pick in that bonus which reaches the other +5 bonus faster. Our
                game plan is to immediately barge into the other +5 bonus to prevent our opponent from getting it.
            </li>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>As a slow picker we only need 3 picks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The main aim during the picking stage is to think about how not to lose to a potentially strong opponent
            first pick, usually in South America.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Guide</h2>
        <p>Contrary to standard WarLight play and especially when the stacks are not yet super large, you want to defend
            your commander with the bare minimum. That way you get the best fights.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the attacker attacks with &lt;28 armies, the defender defending with the bare minimum will get a good
                fight.
            </li>
            <li>If the attacker attacks with &gt;33 armies, the defender defending with the bare minimum loses more than
                the
                attacker.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the slow picker, be careful when the bomb card arrives because your opponent has first order that
            turn.</p>
        <p>A potential win condition is forcing the opponent to bomb you (or he risks getting defeated) while you hold
            onto your bomb card. If you do not need them, it can be smart to hold onto your +4 cards.</p>
        <p>Always keep the move order in mind.</p>

    <section id="final-advice">
        <p>Last but not least, the most important advice:</p>
        <p><strong>You have 3 minutes per move and 5 minutes banked. Use that time. The bomb template is about precise
            calculations. Do not play it on autopilot.</strong></p>
